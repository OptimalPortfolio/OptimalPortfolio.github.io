<!--         <p>We are looking at optimal portfolio construction --- this could be, for example, hedged long on US equities, systematic options trading, macroeconomic predictions and forecasts and etc. We focus on low-frequency data --- data that are available mostly in public and are updated on a daily basis. This means that we assume the portfolio manager to trade at most once a day, and by restricting so, we hope that an optimal strategy would be rather wise and robust. Publications can therefore go through easily, as no private or proprietary data is used at this stage.</p></h3> -->

<!--             <h2>Research description</h2>
 -->            <p>Currently we have two directions of focus.
                <br><br>
                The first focus is related to VIX strategies, architectures, and how an investment portfolio can be improved by including a systematic VIX holding. This research will engage heavily with the asset management literature, where Machine Learning can be seen as a mean to a financial end. We have also created videos displaying the motivation for pursuing this research topic: </p>

                <p>The second focus is about the interpretability of modern ML and stability. Relevant literature being surveyed includes the concepts of Shapley value (<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04209" class="bodylinkhover"> Joseph 2020  </a>)
                 and instabilities (<a href = "https://www.pnas.org/content/117/48/30088" class="bodylinkhover">Hansen 2020 </a> and <a href = "https://parleyyang.github.io/Res/index.html" class="bodylinkhover">Yang 2021</a>)</p>
