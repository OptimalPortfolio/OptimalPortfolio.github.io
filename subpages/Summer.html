    <h1>Summer 2022</h1>
    <h2>Student Research Opportunity
    </h2>

    Student Researcher needed for a summer research project in statistical finance. The project will be related to time series forecasting and statistical machine learning, with applications to financial portfolio management. The project will either extend from previous papers, or comprise a new piece of original work, depending on the interest of the student. Students interested in either statistical research or financial portfolio construction are encouraged to apply. See below for further information.

    <h2>Project Title</h2>

    Portfolio Constructions and Investment Strategies

    <h2>Main Supervisors</h2>
    Parley Yang (Academic Side) and Bobby Previti (Industrial Side)

    <h2>Period and Location of the Project</h2>
    There are no strict geographical restriction on where the student is, neither a set period of time.
    We are looking at around 8 weeks in the summer, depending on student's interests and coding abilities.

    <h2>Brief Description of Project</h2>
    We shall look at optimal combination of portfolio --- this could be, for example, hedged long on US equities, systematic options trading, macroeconomic predictions and forecasts and etc. We focus on low-frequency data --- data that are available mostly in public and are updated on a daily basis. We shall develop portfolio holding strategies on tradable assets, and by the end of the period, produce an industry-level report on such strategy. There is also a direction that the student articulate the research to a more academic side, for instance, on statistical learning and financial applications.

    <h2>How to Apply</h2>
        Students who are interested shall submit their CV, transcripts, and a sample of their python script (and/or Jupyter Notebook) to the following email:
        <u> oprg.enquire@gmail.com </u>

        We check the applications on a rolling basis. The funded and recommended deadline is 25 Februrary. We are likely to hold the first round interview at the end of January.

    <h2>Screening Process and Timeline</h2>
        Students who applied will be considered against their past experience, in particular, their coding ability. There may be emails querying for further materials for clarification. Candidates could be interviewed on zoom by two members of our team. If succesful, they will be invited to complete a
